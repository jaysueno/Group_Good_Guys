The pursuit of happiness is a common human interest. Though it is fairly easy to comprehend
what happiness is, it is often difficult to define why we experience it. In this investigation we
break down national Happiness Scores from the World Happiness Report from the calendar
years 2015 through 2017 and compare it to a variety of metrics, including but not limited to
GDP, life expectancy, perception of freedom, and degree of air pollution.
